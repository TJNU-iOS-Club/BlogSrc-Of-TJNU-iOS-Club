I am a 2019 undergraduate of software engineering at Tianjin Normal University. As a project member, I participated in the 2020 school-level innovation and entrepreneurship project.

My main interest is in human-computer interaction and algorithm research.

Vue.js and other front-end technologies have been studied, and I am currently studying back-end development technologies, such as java.
