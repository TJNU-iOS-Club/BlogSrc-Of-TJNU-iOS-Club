Now I am studying software engineering at Tianjin Normal University. I have a strong interest in computer programming languages ​​and machine learning models, and like to brainstorm and organize my own knowledge system.

Competition experience: As a project member, I participated in the tenth section of China University Student Service Outsourcing Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition. As the project leader, I established Tianjin Normal University School-level Daiso Project.

Research direction: The main research direction at present is machine learning and computer networks.
