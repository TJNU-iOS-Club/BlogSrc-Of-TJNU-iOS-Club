CLUB人员变动通知","type":"post"},{"authors":["Kim Yang"],"categories":null,"content":"原文首发在 Creat4 Me 公众号，点击**传送门**阅读原文～\n 今年，是我加入 TJNU iOS Club 的第三年，也是它的成立的三周年。犹记得，两年前，感动于创建 TJNU iOS Club 的学长说的那一句：“乔布斯说，只有那些疯狂到以为自己能够改变世界的人，才能真正改变世界，我相信你们就是那一群能够改变世界的人。”，我选择加入了 iOS Club！在今天看来，这个选择无疑是我大学生涯作出的最为明智的选择！\n在学长学姐们的带领下，我们迅速成长，尝试过许多不可能，经历过许多第一次。第一次尝试设计社团服装、第一次尝试设计社团 Logo、第一次尝试创作社团招新视频等等。此时，我才发现 iOS Club 不仅仅是一个社团，它更像是一个能让每一个人都能一展示才华的创意乐园。但这些也只是社团活动的一部分而已，分享会、头脑风暴和编程算法讲解等等一大波活动也在火热地开展中。\n分享会中的大开眼界，头脑风暴中的奇思妙想，编程算法中的顿然醒悟等等都是我在社团生活中获得的弥足珍贵的成长。不仅仅就是我，其他的同学也有着自己的成长与收获。在社团生活中，对于作为萌新的我们来说，学长学姐们亦师亦友，不断引导我们发挥自己的想象力，创造着属于我们的乐园。\n参与 Apple Store 的线下课程也是我们最为喜欢的活动。在参与 Apple Store 活动的过程中，我们与 Apple 的讲师面对对面交流，学习到了非常多的使用 Apple 产品的技巧，同时也了解了非常多 Apple 的文化，令人受益非浅。参与 Apple Store 的线下课程也是我们最为喜欢的活动。在参与 Apple Store 活动的过程中，我们与 Apple 的讲师面对对面交流，学习到了非常多的使用 Apple 产品的技巧，同时也了解了非常多 Apple 的文化，令人受益非浅。\n就在我认为岁月静好之际，离别终究还是来临了。今年 6 月，作为社团创始人之一的学长毕业离校了。虽然，学长在一年之前因为实习工作的原因便已不再担任社长一职，但他仍然时常抽时间给我们分享一些技术干货。在社团招新等重要时刻，他也总是赶来为我们站台打气。\n希望学长在美国学习一切顺利，而担任第二任社长的学姐也因为考研的原因希望能将社长的职责交付给我们。社团里的创始人们逐渐因为各种原因不得已离开了社团，而作为初代成员的我们竟然成为了新成员口中的学长学姐。这让我的心中不由得感受到了有一种力量叫做责任。于是，我接受了学姐提出的接任社长的考验——参加移动应用创新赛。在责任心的驱使下，我竟然在大赛报名结束的前两天的时间里想出了参赛的 APP，写出了它的参赛文稿并和另一位同伴一起设计了它的 UI 初稿。\n经过激烈的赛程，我们取得了华北赛区二等奖的成绩。这是我第一个从想法到设计、再到编程都完整参与其中的作品，虽然目前竞赛已经结束，但我们依旧在进行编程开发，将我们曾经设想的功能一一实现。它也让我明白了，每一个 App 的背后都是无数开发者的努力创作，每一个 App 都值得被尊重。竞赛成绩出来之后，学姐决定将社长的职责交付于我，并希望我能带领社团成长得更好。此时我感受到了肩上沉沉的重量，但也有背后坚实的力量。\n由我们社团另一位学长开发的参赛作品-《Get 社交》目前已经完成开发工作并上线 App Store，欢迎大家点击链接下载体验并给我们反馈使用体验。\n九月，又是一年新生季，而我也迎来了社长的第一个工作——为社团招新。第一件事儿就是做招新海报和想面试问题，经过我们一番讨论分工，然后又是好几天的连续奋战，我们终于做出了专属这一届新成员的招新海报和面试问题集锦。\n经过社团每一位成员的热情宣传，今年报名参加社团面试的同学络绎不绝。这是我人生中第一次做面试官，其实我的内心十分紧张。但当我看着面前青涩的他们时，仿佛时光回溯看到了两年前的自己，充着满对知识和技术的渴求。经过紧张的面试，最终，我们也迎来了社团 2019 届新成员。\n迎来新的成员之后，分享会、头脑风暴编程算法等活动依旧火热进行。只不过我从以前参与的成员变成了主要的讲师，身份的转变让我有些拘谨，但我逐渐适应了它，认真的准备每一次活动的内容，希望每一次活动都能带给新成员不一样的收获。但在开展活动的过程中，我逐渐发现给同学们讲述并让他们理解一些知识比自己学习那些知识要困难得多。这要求作为讲师的我具备更好的讲诉能力，也让我收获了不一样的成长！\n参加 Apple store 线下活动依旧是最受新成员欢迎的活动，在 Apple Store 里，新成员能体验最新的 Apple 产品并了解 Apple 整个生态系统的强大与纯净。\n新鲜血液的注入让 iOS Club 变得更加活跃，而作为新任社长的我，也在按部就班地完成了我的工作，但我仍然希望尽我所学为社团做点儿不一样的事情。后来，我发现虽然社团有官方微信，但因为平台的限制，并不能让每一位成员都能参与到社团的宣传内容建设中来，于是，我决定为社团做一个官方网站，以便每一位同学都能参与进来。\n于是，我和社团其他成员经过两个月的设计，两个月的开发，终于将社团官方网站建设得有模有样了。如今，社团每一位成员都能参与到社团官网的内容建设上来，并留下属于他们对社团的记忆。如果你对 TJNU iOS Club 的“记忆”感兴趣的话，欢迎点击链接访问或者扫描下面的二维码访问。同时期待你们的反馈意见～\n正如文章开头所提到的一样，从 TJNU iOS Club 的诞生到现在的三周年，它陪伴我走过了大学时光最为美好的三年，使我逐渐从懵懂变得成熟。在这段时光中，我融入了一个富有创造力和想象力的有爱的团队，我收获了团队合作沟通、与他人分享交流、敢想敢做等等非常多让我受益无穷的成长。同时，我也见证了它从只有几人的小社团发展至如今百人社团，氛围活跃，见证了团服、社团 logo和社团官网等等一件件作品的创作过程。在这段时光中，我们都在共同成长，但我们的故事并未结束，甚至还在谱写，未来依旧可期～\n","date":1583798400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1583798400,"objectID":"69352a669c4dbfcef4ab4f474bcb5c2f","permalink":"/post/20200310-yangjin/","publishdate":"2020-03-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/20200310-yangjin/","section":"post","summary":"今年，是我加入

Premiere是一款常用的视频编辑软件，由Adobe公司推出。现在常用的版本有CS4、CS5、CS6、CC 2014、CC 2015、CC 2017、CC 2018 CC2019以及CC 2020版本。Adobe Premiere是一款编辑画面质量比较好的软件，有较好的兼容性，且可以与Adobe公司推出的其他软件相互协作。目前这款软件广泛应用于广告制作和电视节目制作中。 其最新版本为Adobe Premiere Pro 2020。\n 而在在校大学生手里，我们则用它来在自己手中开创无限的可能，将创意付诸视频，构造传递思想与热情的媒介。刘书璇学姐用社团纳新面试录像这样的本土素材，从创建工程文件这样最基础的的步骤开始，为我们讲解了PR的界面分布、基础操作、常用控件等等，中途涉及可能疑难之处皆加以反复讲解演示、截图记录，详细周致，无论是对之前有接触过相关软件的同学，抑或是完全一无所知者，都有着非常好的引导意义及学习价值。\n通过在教学过程中学姐的实例分享及随后社长所做的补充说明，社团成员们，尤其是我们大一新进成员也都或多或少了解了掌握视频制作技术的意义及需求，对于任何一段视频，哪怕是它再短小，无论是对制作者还是观者而言，都应被认真对待。\n而通过活动， 社员们也都能通过分享会而拥有自己脑内的一些小灵感，并通过在分享会上所学到的技术去加以实践。如此，我们也可以为社团注入更多活力，与创意，藉此达到汇集热爱技术之人的目的，这也正是一次分享会应达到的最高层级的目标。\n分享会内容pdf文件：链接\n这里附上bilibili上PR与AE的教程以供有兴趣的同学继续深入学习：\n Adobe Premiere Adobe After Effect

Pages来搭建个人的博客~\n写在前面 搭建个人博客，一般有三种方法：\n Wordpress：70%的网站都采用这个方法，商业化成熟，简单门槛低； 静态网页+博客框架：代表是Github Page+Hexo，有一定的技术门槛； 自己编写一个网站：前后端都自己实现。  为什么不用Wordpress？ 钱！ 为什么不自己编写？ 难！\n所以，第二种方法用静态网页+博客框架来搭建博客成了我们的最佳选择！\n Hexo 是一个简单、快速、强大的基于 Github Pages 的博客发布工具，支持Markdown格式，有众多优秀插件和主题。\n 而且使用 GitHub Pages 服务搭建博客有众多的好处：\n 全是静态文件，访问速度快； 免费方便，不用花一分钱就可以搭建一个自由的个人博客，不需要服务器不需要后台； 可以随意绑定自己的域名，不仔细看的话根本看不出来你的网站是基于 GitHub 的； 数据绝对安全，基于 GitHub 的版本管理，想恢复到哪个历史版本都行； 博客内容可以轻松打包、转移、发布到其它平台；  是不是迫不及待了呢？马上开始今天的分享~\n搭建步骤 1.安装 Git 、Node.js Hexo 基于 Node.js，搭建过程中还需要使用 npm（Node.js 已带）和 git，因此先搭建本地操作环境，安装 Node.js 和 Git。\n点击下载 Node.js、Git\n2.安装 Hexo 在合适位置新建文件夹，用来存放博客文件。在该⽬录下右键点击Git Bash Here，定位到该文件夹。\n在该文件夹中使用 npm 一键安装 Hexo 博客程序：\nnpm install -g hexo-cli  Mac

适合的人群：学生、白领、文字工作者等需要高生产力工具的人群。如果你本身是一个游戏爱好者，PC 对你来说最大的应用场景就是游戏，那么你也许有更好的选择！\n此文写给即将步入大学学习软件魔法的学弟学妹～\n首先我们需要先来了解一下什么是 Apple 生态圈，简单的来说 Apple 生态圈就是以其旗下的电子产品为入门，然后再以软件系统为主打，最后以服务和理念让用户流连忘返的一个体系。Apple 对创新创意具有高度的认同感，并将之赋予进自己的科技产品中，使产品的理念得以贯彻和延续，借以吸引和打动那些尊重、热爱创新、创意的一小群人，借助他们的影响力推广自己的产品，通过自己产品构建的网络同时反哺创新和创意者，最终形成了良性的软硬件生态，Mac、iPad、iWatch、Airpods、Apple pencil、HomePod、HomeKit、iCloud等各种产品和服务的无缝组合，使用户拥有一种来去自如，行云流水般的感受。\n作为一个半路出道的果粉，接下来主要从多个方面来解析为什么你值得入手一个 Macbook？\n外观 在产品外观设计方面，Apple 一直是处于引领潮流的地位。最为明显的就是曾经使得安卓厂商们争相效仿的刘海屏。一直以来，我都认为 Macbook 不仅仅只是一个生产力工具；从外观上看，我认为它更像是一个艺术品；能与之比肩的 Windows PC，目前我没有接触到.直接上图感受一下吧～\n操作系统 Macbook 上最大的特色就是 Apple 公司特有的 MacOS 操作系统，也是目前主流的三大操作系统（Windows、MacOS、Linux）之一。前面也说了，我是一个半路出道的果粉，那么我使用 Windows 的时间也是有一年多。那么接下来主要由以下几方面进行对比：\n交互设计 交互设计，可以说又是 Apple 公司的一大优势。其中最值得一提的就是触控板：相信许多使用 Windows PC 的朋友外出时免不了随身携带一个鼠标，但是使用 Macbook，你绝不会想要带一个鼠标，因为支持多种手势的触控板可比鼠标好用多了。\n交互方面影响大的便是屏幕的显示效果了，Macbook 的 Retina 屏的显示效果真强过许多的 Windows PC。它采用高亮度 LED 背光、高对比度，因此呈现出来的黑色特别深邃，白色格外明亮。它支持 P3 广色域显示，绿色和红色的显示效果比使用 sRGB 色域时更加鲜艳生动。每一款 MacBook Pro 都加入了原彩显示技术，能根据环境光的色温来自动调节白平衡，带给你更自然的观感。\n资源管理 Windows 有一个很奇妙的现象——使用时间长以后，C盘莫名奇妙就满了，然后系统就会各种卡顿或者删掉一些应用的重要文件。这是因为 Windows 系统会将硬盘空间分区(C 盘、D 盘等等)，而 Windows 系统默认安装在 大小固定的C 盘，而 Windows 上的应用软件也是默认安装在 C 盘中的，这就造成了“磁盘有空间，但系统运行卡顿”的现象，其根本原因便是作为系统盘的 C 盘被塞满了。\n而在 MacOS 上就没有分区的概念，系统及其应用软件均直接使用整块磁盘。当 Macbook 运行卡顿、磁盘空间消耗殆尽时，就真的证明你应该升级硬盘大小了。\nWindows 上的分区概念的弊端除上述之外，还是系统垃圾不断产生的潜在原因。试想当你在安装应用时注意了将其安装在 D 盘，但是其有一部分系统文件还是会出现在 C 盘，而且在删除它的时候，你会发现总有一些文件残留在 C 盘，日积月累，他们就成为了系统垃圾。不仅无用，还占用系统空间，造成系统运行卡顿。\n但是在 MacOS 中所有应用均以 APP 形式打包，删除时很少留下垃圾，这也是为什么 Windows 必备一个垃圾清理应用，而 MacOS 却几乎很少需要垃圾清理应用。\n综上，使用 Windows 比使用 MacOS 需要更好的系统资源管理的能力。\n适配 对于工作中需要用 Windows 的用户(例如：嵌入式开发者)，Apple 也对 Windows 做了适配。可以使用 Boot Camp 轻松安装 Windows，使用双系统。 硬件 硬件可以说一直是 Macbook 的硬伤，因为 Apple 的 PC 产品硬件通常都是落后于硬件市场的潮流的。这是因为 Apple 不同于普通的 Windows PC 的组合厂商直接将零件厂商提供的零件进行组装而产出一个 PC 产品。\nApple 为了使新一代硬件更加适合 MacOS 系统和 它出品的系列 PC 产品，在升级新一代零件之前，会对其进行魔改适配。正是这一魔改的过程，拖后了 Apple 硬件更新的速度。而这也是 MacOS 系统无法直接安装在非Apple 出品的 PC 上的根本原因。\n而硬件也间接导致了另一个问题，许多人都认为 Apple 的 PC 产品性价比低于 Windows PC，但是Windows PC 普遍存在一个问题就是硬件性能和软件质量的不匹配。而这便是 Macbook 的用户体验远高于 Windows PC的原因。其实硬件配置只能代表一台PC的性能顶峰，而我们日常使用的软件——办公系列：WPS 、Office 全家桶；平面设计：PS；视频创作：Pr、Ae等所需求的性能不论是 Macbook 还是 Windows PC。既然基本的性能需求都能满足，那么用户体验就取决于软件质量，而这便是 Macbook 取胜 Windows PC 的根本原因。这就如同 iPhone 相比于安卓机一样，iPhone 的硬件从表面上看是略低于安卓，但用户体验感和系统流畅度却是远高于安卓机的。\n对于编程学习入门的新手来说，Macbook Pro 系列的性能基本已经足够。而且当 Macbook 的性能在视频创作方面遇到瓶颈时，也有外接显卡等不错的解决方案。\n选购 那么说到这里，你是不是已经心动了？但 Apple 给出的选购方案，也是让人又爱又恨的，毕竟钱包不允许。此处不给出太过详细的选购，毕竟 Apple 每一年的产品线均在更新，但仍有以下几点值得注意：\n 编程入门首选 Macbook Pro 系列  Pro 系列是 Macbook 中性能最强的产品线，但这并不是非选它不可的理由。主要还是它的四个雷雳 3 接口十分强大，可扩展性远远强于 Air 系列。\n 雷雳 3 不但拥有超高的带宽，还兼具 USB-C 行业标准的高度多用性，从而打造出一个超高速通用端口。区区一个接口，就将数据传输、充电和视频输出功能集于一身，数据吞吐最高可达 40Gb/s，带宽高达雷雳 2 的两倍。两种尺寸的 MacBook Pro 均提供配备多达四个端口的机型，机身左右两边都可以很方便地使用这些功能。只需一根连接线缆或转换器，即可轻松连接上现有的设备。另外，雷雳 3 的双面可用设计，也让你在接入时无需考虑正反面问题。\u0026gt;\n  电脑硬盘空间至少上到 256GB  学习软件魔法的大学生可能做的最多的事情就是安装 IDE (编程软件)，每一学期都会用到多种 IDE，多装几个就可能出现硬盘空间不够用的情况！\n 对视频创作有兴趣的同学考虑上独显  目前 13 寸的 Macbook Pro 都是集显，即集成显卡，对于视频创作这类十分消耗显卡性能的工作，建议加上独显。而只有 15 寸的 Macbook Pro 才有独显哟～\nMac与Windows之间的权衡 最后从客观上来说，每个人的电脑都有着不同的使用场景，对于轻度办公，修图片剪视频，编辑文章，敲代码，做设计等来说，macOS可能比windows更适合你。无论是开发环境的配置，软件的安装卸载，键盘的快捷化操作，都比windows方便很多。不被弹窗打扰，不用担心病毒、不需要系统优化、甚至可以不用清理垃圾，这些都使你可以转注于使用电脑做事，而不是在\u0026quot;使用\u0026quot;这件事儿本身上浪费时间。就是说，macOS可以使你更\u0026quot;专注\u0026rdquo;。但Mac也有着一些自身局限性，譬如说游戏行业的3dsmax、建筑行业的国产CAD软件、金融财务专业的金蝶和用友，还有微软的办公软件等等。这些软件有的可以安装在虚拟机上，但由于性能的限制，体验并不如windows电脑上好。当然也不是没有解决的办法，但如果你对Windows擅长的部分更加依赖，那么你就要慎重考虑，不能盲从，毕竟与Mac近似价位的Windows笔记本同样有着足够强大的性能。萝卜白菜，各有所爱，选择你喜欢且适合你的就好。\n","date":1564617600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1564617600,"objectID":"ebc5f8ca3ac759b238a1058bfee1c3f1","permalink":"/post/20190801-yangjin/","publishdate":"2019-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/20190801-yangjin/","section":"post","summary":"在开始看正文之前，首先明确

Previous work for emotion recognition have mostly focused on the extraction of carefully hand-crafted and tailored features. Recently, spectrogram representations of emotion speech have achieved competitive per- formance for automatic speech emotion recognition. In this work we propose a method to tackle the problem of deep features, herein denoted as deep spectrum features, extraction from the spectrogram by leveraging Attention-based Bidirectional Long Short-Term Mem- ory Recurrent Neural Networks with fully convolutional networks. The learned deep spectrum features are then fed into a deep neural network (DNN) to predict the final emotion. The proposed model is then evaluated on the Interactive Emotional Dyadic Motion Cap- ture (IEMOCAP) dataset to validate its effectiveness. Promising results indicate that our deep spectrum representations extracted from the proposed model perform the best, 65.2% for weighted accuracy and 68.0% for unweighted accuracy when compared to other existing methods. We then compare the performance of our deep spectrum features with two standard acoustic feature repre- sentations for speech-based emotion recognition.

Previous approaches to emotion recognition have mostly focused on the extraction of carefully hand-crafted features. How to model spatio-temporal dynamics for speech emotion recognition effectively is still under active investigation. In this paper, we propose a method to tackle the problem of emotional relevant feature extraction from speech by leveraging Attention-based Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks with fully convolutional networks in order to automatically learn the best spatio-temporal representations of speech signals. The learned high-level features are then fed into a deep neural network (DNN) to predict the final emotion. The experimental results on the Chinese Natural Audio-Visual Emotion Database (CHEAVD) and the Interactive Emotional Dyadic Motion Capture (IEMOCAP) corpora show that our method provides more accurate predictions compared with other existing emotion recognition algorithms.\nCite @inproceedings{Zhao2018, author={Ziping Zhao and Yu Zheng and Zixing Zhang and Haishuai Wang and Yiqin Zhao and Chao Li}, title={Exploring Spatio-Temporal Representations by Integrating Attention-based Bidirectional-LSTM-RNNs and FCNs for Speech Emotion Recognition}, year=2018, booktitle={Proc.
